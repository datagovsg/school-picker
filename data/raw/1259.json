			"Our school's emphasis lies beyond academic achievements. We strive to enhance holistic learning and provide a balance between equipping our students with knowledge and developing in them the 21st Century competencies and values that will prepare them as Future-Ready Leaders to thrive in an ever changing future that is uncertain and ambiguous. ",
			"In alignment with that vision, Punggol Green Primary has also adopted the FISH! Philosophy to build a positive and dynamic school culture that enhances teaching and learning. Through the practice of the FISH! Philosophy, a safe and playful learning environment is created within the school to enhance personal responsibility and internal motivation amongst staff and students. ",
			"Based on FISH! principles, our teachers created four school mascots - Playto, Attie, Makena and Beth to personify these principles for our students to encourage and motivate our students to embrace the FISH! Philosophy as their way of life, the four principles are integrated into various school programmes.",
			"In order to extend this positive culture to our students' homes, their parents are encouraged to participate in the FISH! Inventory so that they can practise these four simple and yet powerful principles of the FISH! Philosophy with their children at home."
