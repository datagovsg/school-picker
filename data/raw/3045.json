This student-centric approach in educating our students can also be seen in our curriculum. It is designed and implemented by our caring and professional team of teachers who embrace the core belief of 'leave no child behind'. The curriculum is crafted with the learners in mind and seeks to deepen our students' understanding of the various disciplines, making learning engaging and meaningful for them. Working closely with supportive parents and alumni, as well as the community and other partners in education, there is a strong community of support in YTSS to create a nurturing environment and provide the best learning experience for all YTzens. The school motto, 'We will Excel' is the guiding beacon for all YTzens and it permeates the school culture.

Confident Leader: All students participate in the NYAA (Silver) Programme, learning different skill sets and nurturing attributes that ensure holistic development. They also undergo leadership training through the Student Leadership Development Programmes that involve level camps, expeditions and service learning projects. Selected Student Leaders have the opportunities to take part in the Aspiring and Empowering Leaders Programmes to further develop their leadership competencies. NA and NT students develop life skills and vocational skills in the MY LIFE Programme. Active Citizens: Social-emotional competencies are taught through Process Drama and Values@Heart lessons. Classes also plan and carry out Service Learning projects and reflect on our nation's history as they participate in Heritage Trails designed by our teachers. Global Thinkers: The YTSS Cross-Cultural Learning Programmes expand our students' global outlook while developing their intercultural competencies through local and overseas exchange programmes and learning journey. The STAR Programmes also challenges our students cognitively through interesting research projects in collaboration with Institutes of Higher Learning, both local and overseas."
