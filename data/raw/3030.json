		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our school's distinctiveness is founded on four signature programmes; i) LEAD@TMS, ii) Cross-Cultural Awareness (C2A), iii) the Temasek Ignis Programme (TIP) and iv) niche CCA opportunities.LEAD@TMS offers student leaders the opportunity to develop values, competencies and knowledge through a customised student leadership programme. Based on their interests and talents, students are formally appointed into one of the five leadership groups where they lead in various school-level and community-based activities. Additionally, to successfully navigate a culturally diverse world, all student leaders are developed in C2A to deepen their understanding of other cultures and strengthen their global perspective.C2A is also made available to all lower secondary students via Project Culture which piques their curiosity to learn about the similarities and difference between cultures, as well as Camp Culture, which enable students to delve deeper into cultural issues after visiting various religious sites. Beyond leadership and culture, TMS also has a talent development programme known as TIP. This programme caters to students who demonstrate strong intellectual curiosity and personal drive. With the purpose to develop independent learners, confident thinkers and innovators, 'TIPpers' are stretched to further hone academic skills and student leadership ability. Finally, school distinctiveness is also captured through four niche CCAs- Canoeing, Shooting, Drama or Choir, which aim to nurture gifts in sports and the aesthetics; in the process, instilling a sense of commitment, self-reliance and a spirit of service to others."
