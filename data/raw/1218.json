			"Anchored on our philosophy of being 'Committed to Providing an All-round Education in a Caring Environment Aimed at Bringing Out the Best in Each and Every Child', and our belief that 'Character is the Foundation', the school's distinctiveness lies in our emphasis on character development. Being recognised as the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is a testament of this. ",
			"In line with the above, the school promotes a culture of care and excellence as articulated in the school's vision of 'A Caring School that Strives for Excellence'. This is done through the adoption of school values of respect, care, harmony, resilience, responsibility and integrity - Respect, care and harmony to create a culture of care and resilience; responsibility and integrity to build a culture of excellence. The school values form the basis on which good attitudes and behaviours are cultivated.",
			"The school also encourages a growth mindset and continually pushes for improvements and innovation as part of our pursuit of excellence.  Emphasis on well-being and growth of staff and students is part of our caring school culture.  We nurture a caring culture by putting our students first and providing for their socio-emotional needs, and through multiple platforms that involve the curricular, co-curricular and positive relationship building efforts.  ",
			"In promoting excellence amongst pupils, recognition is given to those who demonstrate good values as well as those who strive for excellence and improvements. Recognition is done via platforms such as 'Catch Them Doing Right', the 'Roll of Honour' (ROH) programme, highlighting of good behaviour at assemblies, academic awards, as well as the Edusave Character Award (ECHA). The ROH programme recognises students  who are exemplary in the display of the six school values, and the ROH Board highlights those who have been exemplary in role-modelling the 'Value for the Month'."
