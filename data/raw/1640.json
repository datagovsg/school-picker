		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Applied Learning Programme - Habits of Mind (HOM) The school embarked on HOM to enable students to go through thinking processes and display thinking dispositions to become self-directed learners. Students acquire knowledge and skills during the explicit teaching of HOM. The games approach is used to teach these habits and inject the element of fun. Video clips, group activities and reflections provide a myriad of learning experiences. Students also engage in activities conducted during pre-assembly sessions and continue the fun of learning beyond the curriculum by using board games. These habits are further integrated in the academic and non-academic subjects to enable students to internalize and display the thinking dispositions of self-directed learners.  Learning Buffet Learning Buffet is a platform where students immerse themselves in the Hi-5 experience-Intellectual, Technological, Art and Cultural, Life-skills and Leadership. The school transforms into borderless classrooms where students have the autonomy to select and attend workshops based on their interests. Hands-on learning experiences enable them to discover their strengths and ignite their curiosity.   Innovators' Hatter Day Innovators' Hatter Day-a day of ideation which allows students to think and come out with creative solutions to authentic problems. Students are presented with innovative modifications of everyday items to expose them to authentic problems and solutions. This progresses to Hatter Challenge where they are encouraged to identify challenges around them, brainstorm ideas and build prototypes as part of the solutions.  On this day, students showcase their Inter-disciplinary Project Work (IPW) by presenting their research-based solutions to current and anticipated problems. This prepares them to become future-ready problem solvers. Concurrent to the IPW exhibition is Innocube-a Thinking Hub where students use recycled materials to illustrate and share ideas on environmental problems."
