			"The school's mission states its commitment to instilling in every child a zeal for learning, embracing innovation in teaching and learning and developing upright and responsible citizens.  The school values of Patriotism, Resilience, Integrity, Discipline and Empathy (PRIDE), are in alignment with its vision. ",
			"Changkat Primary is committed to delivering a student-centric, values-driven education for all her students through the provision of a Differentiated Curriculum where teachers provide for different learner types. Learner information such as that obtained from formative assessments is actively sought to enable responsive teaching and active learning. To create a sense of autonomy and ownership, students are involved in tracking, reflecting on and following up on their areas for improvement and strengths. ",
			"In the area of Pastoral Care, we strive to provide multiple platforms which encourage positive teacher-student interactions. This ensures timely gathering of student information to improve support structures and processes. The school also leverages students as a resource base to beef up pastoral support for all children. All these serve to create an environment that is secure and conducive for learning and play.",
			"Changkat Primary provides a total curriculum that nurtures the whole child. We believe that the school curriculum and programmes need to be supported by strong Home-School Collaboration for greater effectiveness. Through multiple communication platforms, we ensure that parents are provided with useful and timely information about school policies and activities. This encourages active participation from parents in their child's school life and facilitates fruitful partnership between parents and teachers to meet the needs of every child."
