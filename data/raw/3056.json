		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "In Damai, we believe every child has the capacity to learn with the encouragement, motivation and guidance we give them. In addition to providing students with an academic curriculum to develop cognitive skills, knowledge and attitudes, we also focus on character and leadership development. Our LLP builds students' character, leadership and life-skills like resilience and a collaborative spirit to navigate life's challenges. The school's unique Values-in-Action (VIA) programme provides excellent opportunities to translate values and leadership skills into action and nurture concerned citizens, active contributors and confident leaders of the 21st century. The LLP-infused Waterways Clean-up is a rare opportunity to use kayaking skills to care for the environment and appreciate water as a precious resource. STEM-ALP infused VIA initiatives such as visits to NKF and old folks' homes provide yet another platform to further develop empathy as we nurture them to become compassionate leaders. We are heartened that our students have done well in both academic and character domains over the years.  With support from parents and collaboration with tertiary institutions, we will continue to ride on the waves of academic and character excellences that characterise Damai culture, vision, mission and values.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school has 2 distinctive programmes. To embrace the challenges of the 21st century, Damai seeks to anchor students on sound values and develop them as leaders of good character with a sense of belonging to school and nation. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Character, Citizenship and Leadership Development through Water Sports, develops students to become Committed, Competent and Compassionate Leaders with an appreciation for life-long fitness. Through a tiered experience Damaians are introduced to water sports like swimming, kayaking, dragon boating, wakeboarding and sailing. Through this they also learn to appreciate 'water' not just as a precious resource, but also understand its qualities and value. Our STEM-Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Health Sciences and Healthcare Technology aims to provide authentic learning experiences for students to apply learning in real-world contexts, acquire complex problem solving skills and widen perspectives on healthcare and health sciences industries. The learning environment also fosters team work and open-ended tinkering to enable students to develop 21st Century Competencies and an innovative spirit. STEM-ALP also aims to create awareness and deepen learning on health-related issues, such as nutritional sciences, infectious diseases, healthcare technologies and palliative care for the disabled and elderly. Our extensive partnership with external partners exposes students to the developments in the healthcare sector and allows them to gain deeper insights into healthcare and health sciences related careers. The school will also offer Retail Operations, an Applied ITE subject, as an optional elective to S3NT students from 2017 to better meet their aspirations."
