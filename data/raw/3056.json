Together, members of the school community will forge a new identity with an emerging school culture and ethos.  Concerted efforts by all parties involved in creating a conducive environment for teaching and learning, as well as for growth and development for staff and students will provide the impetus for the school's journey ahead. Every individual has a role to play and a purpose in life. The school will provide students with opportunities to discover themselves through their studies, interaction and engagement with others (peers, teachers as well as the wider community), active participation in school activities and programmes, application of values and skills learnt in authentic settings, and reflections on lessons learnt.  We believe everyone has the capacity to contribute to the good of society and make a positive difference in everything they do.
