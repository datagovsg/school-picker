		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Since 2005, Meridian Primary has placed strong emphasis on the importance of environmental education. The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) 'Nurturing Future Leaders, Citizens and Leaders through a Whole School Interdisciplinary Approach in Eco-Environmental Curriculum' aims to raise global awareness, perspectives and issues affecting the physical environment among our students. Adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, our students are provided with various platforms and opportunities that allow them to apply their knowledge and lead as they initiate and embark on meaningful eco-environmental programmes. These experiences will further instil in our students the values of care, concern and respect for the environment. Meridian Primary has also been collaborating closely with community partners in championing and promoting environment-related activities within and outside the school. Through this, we hope to groom and nurture Meridians to be future leaders who will continue to champion eco-environment efforts, not only in Singapore but beyond our shores."
