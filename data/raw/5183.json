			"MTS fully embraces a Student-Centric, Values-Driven Education. Character development remains a hallmark of the education at MTS, recognised by the parents, key partners and the community. The school motto continues its relevance through the eight school values below which are drawn up to augment the school's Character and Citizenship Education:",

			"Conscience: Resilience and Excellence",
			"Purity: Confidence and Integrity",
			"Righteousness: Respect and Service",
			"MTS aspires to be a school of distinction, which is steeped in traditions and has an eye for the future. We seek to develop each student to be a whole person with a global outlook but rooted in his responsibility to his family, school, community and Singapore. To this end, MTS designs a quality learning environment and develops innovative school-based programmes that deepen and broaden the learning of school values and the development of 21st century competencies in the students.",
			"Over the years, our students have done well in both the academic and non-academic domains. This success is the collective effort of a nurturing team of dedicated teachers, as well as strong support from the school management committee, our alumni, parents and the larger community."
