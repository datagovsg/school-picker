		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "We firmly believe that education must be forward-looking and robust, recognising that the future, for which Yuhuans are being prepared for, is dynamic, unpredictable and difficult to imagine. Leveraging on the culture of care, learning and excellence, we envision our school to be a learning organisation that empowers staff and nurtures students holistically by equipping them with the competencies and dispositions to thrive in the future. Our school philosophy, \"Every Student, Our Responsibility\" undergirds our commitment to honour learning by instilling in Yuhuans the responsibility and commitment to life-long learning so as to adapt to changes and new situations; strengthen character by inculcating the values of graciousness and integrity, awaken talents by harnessing their strengths to strive towards attaining purposeful goals with passion and resilience, inspire dreams by stretching Yuhuans potential to lead new frontiers and innovate in pursuit of excellence.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "In tandem with providing multiple pathways and inspiring Yuhuans to pursue their interests, Electronics and Mobile Robotics are introduced as applied subjects. Yuhuans will acquire skills and knowledge in fundamentals of electronics and fields of mechatronics engineering through experiential and practice-based learning. Using an integrative and progressive approach in curricular design, our Flagship Programmes such as Literacy Enhancement Through Timed English Reading, Math Cube, Interdisciplinary Scientific Exploratory and Experiential Learning and the ApT Reader (Mother Tongue Languages) aim to make learning visible and engender a greater level of engagement in learning. Complementing the curriculum is our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Integrated Project and Events Management (I-PRESENT) which helps Yuhuans develop thinking skills and apply knowledge in authentic settings. Yuhuans are exposed to higher learning through the offering of events and projects management-related Advanced Elective Modules by polytechnics and collaboration with community and industry partners. Our Learning-for-Life Programme (LLP), MELODY (Music-Empowered Learners, Our Dynamic Yuhuans) harnesses our long-standing tradition of musical excellence to nurture the attributes of creativity, precision, teamwork, discipline and confidence in every Yuhuan. The music curriculum allows Yuhuans to experience diverse genres of music and showcase their talents at various platforms. Musically talented Yuhuans can offer GCE O Level Music under the Enhanced Music Programme. Our yCARE module, an integration of CCE, VIA, ICT and Project Work, the Cohort Leadership programmes and Life Skills modules further imbues in Yuhuans values and equip them with the 21 century competencies and skills."
