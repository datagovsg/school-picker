			"A school started by the community for the community",
			"      Established in 1933, Pei Chun Public School was started by a group of Hainanese who wanted to provide an education for the children of the Chinese working class. As the only school in Singapore bearing the word \"public\", the school name clearly signifies the intent of our founders - a school started by the community for the community.  The school became a government-aided school in 1956. In recognition of its consistent records of good PSLE results and a learning environment rich in Chinese language and culture, Pei Chun was accorded the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) status in 1990. ",
			"Putting pupils at the heart of all our education processes",
			"      The school vision and mission reflect what we firmly believe to be the fundamental outcomes for our pupils at this key stage of their education.  These outcomes encompass all the domains that make up the total person - cognitive, physical, aesthetics, social and moral, leadership and morale.  Above all else, the underpinning tenet is that the development of our pupils is at the heart of all our education processes. ",
			"Rich SAP Culture with strong emphasis on Character Building ",
			"     An established school with rich SAP culture, the school continues to appeal to parents who value a strong bilingual and bicultural learning environment with strong emphasis on character building. Guided by our school values of courtesy, justice, honesty and honour, Pei Chun strives to nurture our pupils to be bilingual and responsible citizens, with a desire to contribute beyond themselves to their family, society and country.",
			"     In charting the growth of Pei Chun in the next chapter, the school is committed to providing a quality bilingual education for our pupils, living up to its name and our founders' vision of providing a quality education for the community."
