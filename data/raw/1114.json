We have many engaging programmes in place to achieve this, and our staff is committed to providing a student-centric, values driven education for our pupils.",

We believe in building quality relationships so that we can work together to value add to our pupils' learning and development. Our key partners and active Parent Support Group are instrumental in providing valuable authentic experiences and positive role modelling for our pupils to learn through Values in Action.",
			"Our pupils' zest to excel has helped the school to build a reputation of excellence in the area of sports, performing arts and visual arts. These are key avenues through which the school provides a holistic education for our pupils, and the character traits and attitudes developed from these avenues have served our pupils well in both academic and non-academic aspects of their education journey.",

As we help pupils to develop 21st century skills, we also continue to stress our core values - respect, resilience, passion, adaptability, collaboration and innovation, which will guide our pupils as they grow to make a difference in society."
