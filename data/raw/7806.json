As a Specialised School for Normal (Technical) students, we offer a four-year customised curriculum that integrates both academic learning and vocational training. Learning is practice-oriented, with an emphasis on skills development to better prepare our students for post-secondary learning at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and for future employment. Industry attachment is an important component of our students' holistic learning experience. In addition, our teachers deploy innovative pedagogies to strengthen our students' literacy and numeracy skills through real-world, ICT-enriched learning contexts. The school adopts a multi-faceted approach to develop our students as well-rounded individuals, anchored in good character and equipped with the skills and social and emotional competencies to succeed in life. The school collaborates with many partners from the industry and community to support our students' learning and holistic development. At the end of Sec 4, our students will graduate with the GCE 'N' Level Certificate and the ITE Skills Subject Certificate (ISSC).",
