In this ALP - C.R.E.A.T.E. or Creative Robotics Experience through Authentic Thinking Exposure - students will develop problem-solving, critical thinking and collaborative learning skills when they build LEGO robotic sets to complete specific tasks which transform abstract STEM concepts into tangible hands-on learning experiences. In the co-curriculum area, excellent platforms are provided for our students to develop strength of character, values and inculcate the Growth Mindset to overcome challenges that come their way in life. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Sports & Sportsmanship Programme (Sports Experience, Sports Development and Sports Excellence), is the core programme for character building. Our students actively participate in and develop their passion and aptitude in a wide variety of sports and activities. Sportsmanship values, character and attitudes are constantly emphasised. Other key programmes in character building include Student Leadership Development Programme, Sec 3 Adventure and Leadership Camp and Science Talent Development Programme."
