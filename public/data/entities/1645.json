		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"Established in 1958, Marsiling Primary School (MPS) has one of the longest history and heritage among schools in the Marsiling/Woodlands estate. The Marsiling Experience is anchored on a student-centric, values-driven, and holistic education to equip our students with the relevant skills and competencies to navigate a fast-changing world, and to develop them to become Responsible Learners and Compassionate Leaders who can Learn, Lead and Serve.",
			"OUR PHILOSOPHY",
			"In MPS, we believe that developing the 21st century competencies and the focus on meaningful student engagement will enhance our students' cognitive and affective development, and eventual success in life. We will continue to inculcate the right values in our students and equip them with the relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes to better prepare them for future challenges. Through a comprehensive academic and co-curricular programme, anchored on student centric and values-driven learning, we hope to nurture all our students to achieve their full potential. In their 6 years at MPS, our students will grow to become Responsible Learners and Compassionate Leaders, ready to serve the community and nation as active young citizens.",
			"OUR SCHOOL VALUES",
			"The school values are encapsulated in the acronym R2IC2E (Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Commitment, Care and Esprit de Corps) and integrated into both the formal and informal curriculum of the school.",
			"OUR SCHOOL MOTTO",
			"The school motto Ilmu Suluh Hidup (translated to mean 'Knowledge lights up our Lives'), as reflected in the school crest, continues to be of relevance today. The four interlocking rings represent our closely-knit multi-racial school population working in harmony. The stalk of padi is symbolic of hard work and effort required for success. The star reflects the belief we have that every student can achieve and education (symbolised by the pen) will blaze the way ahead for our students (as shown by the torch)."
