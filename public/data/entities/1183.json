We are committed to nurturing students who find joy in living, loving and learning. We believe that teachers are professionals who are good role models for our students. Our teachers are curriculum leaders who endeavour to design learning experiences that best meet the needs of our students. Our teachers are also caring educators who create a safe and conducive environment for learning. We believe that parents are the children's first teachers and play an instrumental role in our students' growth and development. The school thus seeks to establish strong partnership and close collaboration with our parents in order to provide the best education for every child. We believe in our calling to prepare our students for the future by equipping them with a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy and developing in them future-ready skills. We are proactive in helping students acquire the attitudes and attributes which would stand the test of time."
