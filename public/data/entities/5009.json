		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"St Andrew's Village which consists of the SAJS, SASS and SAJC pride ourselves as one family where students have the opportunity to have twelve years of education in servant leadership. We believe that all who enters the gate can be educated to become servant leaders who brings life to the nation through developing our students to be holistic thinkers, skilled communicators and community builders with exemplary character demonstrating TRUE (Thanksgiving, Resilience, Unity, Empathy)  and WISE (Wonder, Integrity, Self-Discipline, Excellence)character values. ",
			"A holistic thinker applies analytical, reflective and creative thinking skills to his learning. An analytical thinker is able to reason logically and explain the decisions made based on evidence.  A reflective thinker is able to recount past experiences and link them to current situations to grow and make improvements in his learning. Creative thinking will help students to brainstorm and generate new ideas to respond appropriately to a given issue or challenge. ",
			"A skilled communicator listens attentively to others, expresses himself well and is media smart. He should be able to ask appropriate questions, to clarify or challenge others' ideas and points of view. He also demonstrates good posture and body language. By learning how to express himself, the skilled communicator shares his thoughts and feelings with clarity and confidence. He is able to engage others with mutual respect. ",
			"A community builder works effectively in teams. He is about to collaborate in a respectful manner and encourages others to contribute ideas to the team. ",
			"By actively participating in school and community activities, the community builder is able to demonstrate awareness and appreciation of people from different socio-cultural and religious backgrounds in the community. He contributes positively to others and the environment by demonstrating mutual respect and acceptable behaviour that promotes social cohesion."
