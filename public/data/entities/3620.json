This will be done through the provision of equal access to developmental opportunities, and, regardless of level or stream, talents and interests, all students will be ensured of a strong foundation in the knowledge, skills and competencies required for success in life in the 21st Century. Even more importantly, all students will be imbued with strong moral values and a sense of social responsibility, so that they may continue to serve and contribute to their community even after they leave Westwood.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Westwood offers two distinctive programmes. Through our Applied Learning Programme on Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship (ISE), students will develop specialised knowledge of innovation and entrepreneurship that will enable them to make effective contributions to the community. The ISE curriculum is integrated in both the Academic and Co-Curriculum so that students are able to make connections and apply the knowledge and skills learnt in different contexts. In addition, students will be engaged in \"Arts for Life!\", our Learning for Life Programme where they are exposed to Visual Arts and Design, Music and Performing Arts.  Both distinctive programmes will provide extensive platforms for our students to ideate, experiment and explore as well as hone their 21st century skills and competencies where they will have opportunities to apply these skills in authentic contexts. Westwood also offers a Talent Development Programme (TDP) for students who are stronger in their academic studies. These students will be provided with ample opportunities to hone their communication & presentation skills, as well as stimulate their intellectual curiosity and develop greater awareness of international issues and their impact through participation in conferences/seminars/forums/projects and build a personal portfolio in the process."
