The school's Life-Long Programme is STAR (Sportsmanship Teamwork And Resilience) where students develop these values through physical activities such as sports and outdoor adventure camps. To nurture students into Global Citizens of Character and Learning, all Lower Secondary students attend a Character Development Adventure Camp and Sec 3 students participate in a 5-day MOE-Outward Bound School Challenge Programme at Pulau Ubin.  There are opportunities for Student Leaders to take part in student exchange programmes with schools in Cambodia, Taiwan and Australia. In addition, students take part in Integrated Humanities and CCE Learning Journeys, CCE Lectures, Harmony@Senja (Integrated VIA/CCE Programme) and Leadership Development Programmes."
