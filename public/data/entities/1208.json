The school also believes that each pupil is a learner who is constantly reflective, actively sharing, continuously learning and possesses the ability to aesthetically respond. ",
			"The school believes in the inculcation of values and life skills mastery as these skills are essential for the pupils to face future challenges in the globalised world. As such, the teaching of values is integral to the school's curriculum and co-curriculum programmes. Pupils who have displayed the school values consistently will be affirmed through the presentation of the Fuchun Values Award in each term. Bi-monthly assembly talks are carried out to reiterate the importance of values in building character.  ",
			"The school believes that the quality of teaching and learning depends on its teachers. Hence, as part of professional development, teachers are actively engaged in discussion to question their assumptions, share subject expertise and teaching strategies to better engage the learners. The school is also proud of its strong culture of care among the staff.  Through the empowerment by the school leaders and the inclusive environment provided in the school, this culture of care is further strengthened and passed on to the pupils. Under the positive influence of their teachers who show concern, pupils demonstrate the value of care through their thoughts, words and deeds."
