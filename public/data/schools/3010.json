Students' learning is guided by innovative teaching methodologies such as the Inquiry-based approach in Science and the Integrated Coursework approach in Craft and Technology. Our students are also provided with rich and diverse learning experiences both locally and overseas. Student Recognition is an integral part of our culture. Upper Secondary students can also strive for the Serangoon StaR awards for overall excellence in various areas. More than 90% of students graduate with at least an NYAA (Bronze) award. We value our partners and we value partnerships to enhance student learning. The Parent Support Group is actively involved in providing support, engaging parents, and networking to enrich students' learning. The school offers Computing and Mobile Robotics as Elective Subjects.
