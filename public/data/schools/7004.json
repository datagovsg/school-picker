In CHIJ, all lower secondary students experience our in-house drama programme which enable students to realise their creative talents and develop their artistic vision. Our Affective Programmes focus on character development and include the Developmental Leadership Programme, the Values-in-Action programme, self-awareness camps, work attachment programme, and adventure camps. As the South Zone Centre of Excellence for Language and the Arts, CHIJ is home to many strong performing arts groups. At the same time, CHIJ's sports CCA groups have experienced success on the school scene. Our signature IJ Goes Global Programme aims to equip IJ students with a more global perspective and includes Immersion and Twinning Programmes with overseas schools, and the IJ Beacon Programme which focuses on serving the disadvantaged in neighbouring countries."
