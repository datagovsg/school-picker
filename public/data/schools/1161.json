Stakeholders are roped in to enhance pupils# learning experiences, as well as provide opportunities for pupils to gain more exposure.  The ESP adopts the 3H approach which covers 3 key developmental domains # HEAD (knowledge & skills acquisition), HEART (values acquisition) and HANDS (participation & contribution). The programme aims to develop pupils to continuously use concepts, skills and processes to inquire into phenomena related to the environment, think creatively and critically in solving environmental problems, and have strong conviction in bettering the environment. Pupils with greater aptitude and interest are given opportunities to lead their peers in community involvement activities, as well as conduct sharing to create awareness on environment conservation. This is in line with the Schools Vision to develop every Si Ling Pupil into a Scholar who Leads and Serves."
