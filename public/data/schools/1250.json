		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Creative Problem Solving (CPS) as a school-wide Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to develop students' creativity and critical thinking skills through the process of problem-solving.  The ALP serves as a platform for the integration of the thinking tools across various subjects, the deepening of SEL skills and the application of the thinking skills. CPS adopts the Four Sight Model. The progressive approach taken is with the desire to nurture all Innovians with the basic problem solving skills and the 21st Century Competencies.  Leading Through Serving as the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) provides Innovians with real-life learning experiences to develop students into morally upright individuals and useful citizens.  It also inculcates values and strengthens students' self-expression and interpersonal skills. The school hopes to instil a sense of rootedness, responsibility for their community and a willingness to serve fellow Singaporeans through programmes like Use Your Hand Campaign, Active Recess, Care for the seniors via the Intergenerational Bonding and Learning programme, Care for the Underprivileged and Care for the Environment.  The Character and Leadership Education programme (CLE) is a weekly school-wide values education programme which nurtures Innovians to be Champions of Character and Citizenry. The use of the Narrative Approach in CLE Lessons for Lower Primary was introduced in 2017 to innovatively promote the \"Joy of Learning\".   The school provides a total of 19 Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) to provide all Innovians with a platform to develop their interests and talents. Students develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups. CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies."
