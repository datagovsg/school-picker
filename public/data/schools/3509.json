		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Since 1959, Serangoon Garden Secondary School (SGS) has been enjoying the trust and confidence of the community and alumni over the last 58 years.  The SGS brand of education is known and valued for growing our students to be future-ready in the culture of care, learning and excellence. The culture of care is evident in the school as our students grow and develop in a safe and nurturing environment, marked by respect for teachers and peers. Anchored on the culture of learning, the vision of the school is based upon our commitment to educate our students to be able to exercise sound reasoning and reflective thinking to make good decisions and manage complexities and ambiguities. They are also able to lead themselves and others effectively with empathy and the heart to care and serve with PRIDE. One of our key beliefs is that all our students are able to learn. As such, we have in place systems and processes to stretch the talent of our higher ability students; at the same time, we have a range of student-centric intervention programmes to help the weaker students so that they can progress and achieve. Committed to the culture of excellence, we challenge our students to take responsibility for their learning, while giving them the necessary support to realise their aspirations. Our goal is to nurture your child academically, grow them socially and emotionally, and guide them towards independent thinking and problem solving. Our end goal is that SGSians will be 'Critical Thinkers and Thoughtful Leaders.'",

Students in the Express Course enjoy course attachments with Nanyang Polytechnics as part of our extensive ECG collaborations, while students in the Normal Course will benefit from student-centred programmes which are acknowledged by MOE through the Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovations in the Normal Course that inculcate 21st century competencies and skills to prepare them for life.

This programme is also opened to non-Chinese students. Sec 3 ALP Programme to provide a platform for students to facilitate learning for peers and members of the public, while giving back to the community.
