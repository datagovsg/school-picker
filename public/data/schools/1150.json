		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "In AMKPS, we believe that the Purpose of education is not to prepare our students for life in the future, but for life in the present as well. Hence, the sum of experiences of in the AMKP curriculum does not solely serve academic preparations for progression to the stage of formal education or for economic contribution, but also includes teaching our students how to take care of their own personal development and being a civil member of the community and a concerned citizen for the country.  In AMKPS, we believe that all students have the Potential and Desire to learn. They want to learn more about themselves, more about the world and how they can better relate to the world. All students can learn. Yet every child is unique in his/her interests, perspective of the world around them, hopes and aspirations. Hence, it is important to hear the child's voice, and when we begin to recognize and appreciate it, we can better engage the child to care for, guide and inspire him/her.  In AMKPS, we believe in the Provision of equitable access to quality learning experiences for all students, regardless of their background. Based on the different students' readiness levels, we must provide multiple methods and approaches by which students may benefit from diverse learning experiences, and experience success in various domains.  Based on these 3 core beliefs about the Purpose of Education, Potential of Learners, and Provision of Equitable Access, we have conceptualized the AMKP Experience Wheel which is driven 5 critical success factors. They are: a) Values Integration  b) Voice & Ownership c) Quality Relationship d) Opportunities for All e) Growth Mindset  These 5 factors interact and influence the design of all learning programmes and experiences in AMKPS to develop within our students important Leadership Habits which form the set of desired student behavioural outcomes to help them become young leaders who are self-directed learners and morally upright citizens.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "AMKPS offers a Learning for Life Programme (LLP) known as AMKP Leadership Inspired Values Education (ALIVE) for all students from Primary 1 to 6.  ALIVE aims to develop in every AMKP student a set of Values-Driven Leadership Habits to be an effective and self-directed learner; and to be able to make right decisions, as a responsible and concerned citizen of Singapore.  Students who display the Leadership Habits consistently and are role models are given higher leadership appointments such as school prefects and Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Leaders are provided with leadership training opportunities to stretch their leadership potential.  More than a stand-alone programme, ALIVE is conceptualised as a holistic curriculum comprising various learning experiences; some integrated into the school's total curriculum while some are key components of the school's CCE programme.  ALIVE's programme design is outcome-driven and values-based. Thirteen Leadership Habits are unpacked from the 6 core school values: Care, Respect, Integrity, Responsibility, Resilience and Excellence. These habits are closely aligned with the 21st Century Competencies and MOE Desired Outcomes. From the 13 Habits, progressive level-based behavioural outcomes are crafted to make learning of the Habits age-appropriate and evidence-based.  Character Matters for Leaders (CML) is the main instructional programme for ALIVE, delivered by Form and Co-Form teachers for at least 30 minutes a week. In these CML lessons, students are exposed to moral reasoning discussion, active learning skills, and personal well-being tools. Since 2015, Values in Action (VIA) projects has become a key part of the CML sessions to provide a platform for students to apply Leadership Habits in community service projects.  ALIVE also includes a set of assessment platforms e.g. Caught Right in the Act (CRITA), PRAISE cards, to recognise and monitor the attainment of the desired Behavioural outcomes based on the Leadership Habits."
