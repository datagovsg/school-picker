		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school's APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME (ALP) - CRITICAL AND INVENTIVE THINKING THROUGH MEDIA LITERACY, focuses on developing students' critical and inventive thinking (CIT) skills. Media literacy anchored in the history and geography curriculum seeks to develop students as critical consumers and producers of information. Through this distinctive programme, students develop the skills to analyse sources of information presented in different media types and acquire an array of media related skills that culminate in the presentation and production of media products such as video clips and infographics set in an authentic context. This programme is also supported by the English Language Department and the Craft and Technology Department.  The school's LEARNING FOR LIFE PROGRAMME (LLP) - DEVELOPING COMMUNITY LEADERS THROUGH VIA AND OUTDOOR EDUCATION, premised on values inculcation and service orientation, seeks to develop Community Leaders who are innovative, confident and caring. To achieve this, Values-in- Action Projects (ranging from service learning to social advocacy) at each level enable students to become change makers who lead and serve at school, community, national and regional levels. Outdoor Education (OE) offers students the opportunity to strengthen leadership development, resilience and ruggedness. Both VIA and OE collectively allow students to acquire and demonstrate the school values of excellence, commitment, integrity, teamwork and empathy."
