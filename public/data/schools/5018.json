		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Montfort Junior School is an all-boys institution of learning and we focus on providing a boys centric educational experience. Believing that boys learn differently, our teaching and learning program, facilities and resources are designed with Boys Centric Education (BCE) in mind. Our programs are designed to facilitate peer learning, encourage movement, be experiential in nature and differentiated to meet individual's needs. Programs are designed to stretch the potential as well as support learning needs.  Mindful of our responsibility to develop our students to be future ready, one of our key programs is the infusion of computational thinking skills into the curriculum. Students are systematically introduced to computational thinking at all levels and these skills are further reinforced during curriculum time.   Badminton has been our prominent sport and a strong tradition for many years and we have been awarded niche status, based on our excellence in this area. With this spirit of excellence and a strong sporting tradition, our school has also developed a strong sporting structure to support our boys' involvement in other sports like softball, football, table tennis, wushu and Tae Kwon Do. We see participation in sports as opportunities for our boys to pursue excellence in both their physical performance and character. With boys playing in different teams, they have opportunities for personal growth as they stimulate each other through mutual encouragement, challenge and support.  Our school's Learning for Life Program (LLP) is focused on developing the CHRISTE values through involvement in sports. Leveraging on our strong sporting culture, our LLP provides opportunities for all Montfortians to learn different sports through their years in MJS and through their involvement, develop their character."
