		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Mee Toh School (MTS) is a government-aided primary school founded by Venerable Sek Kong Hiap with strong support from the Buddhist community in 1954 to provide students with education opportunities and through it to develop their character so that each student can lead a fulfilled life guided by the school motto - compassion, conscience, purity, righteousness.  MTS fully embraces a Student-Centric, Values-Driven Education. Character development remains a hallmark of the education at MTS, recognised by the parents, key partners and the community. The school motto continues its relevance through the eight school values below which are drawn up to augment the school's Character and Citizenship Education:  Compassion: Care and Teamwork Conscience: Resilience and Excellence Purity: Confidence and Integrity Righteousness: Respect and Service  MTS aspires to be a school of distinction, which is steeped in traditions and has an eye for the future. We seek to develop each student to be a whole person with a global outlook but rooted in his responsibility to his family, school, community and Singapore. To this end, MTS designs a quality learning environment and develops innovative school-based programmes that deepen and broaden the learning of school values and the development of 21st century competencies in the students.  Over the years, our students have done well in both the academic and non-academic domains. This success is the collective effort of a nurturing team of dedicated teachers, as well as strong support from the school management committee, our alumni, parents and the larger community.",

The school also practices Up-cycling to give old items of historical significance a new  life within the school campus. The \"Keep the School Clean\" Programme creates ownership in the students  through daily cleaning activities so that they are responsible for the clean and tidy school and public areas that everyone can enjoy."
