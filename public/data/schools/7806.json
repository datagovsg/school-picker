Learning is practice-oriented, with an emphasis on skills development to better prepare our students for post-secondary learning at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and for future employment.

In addition, our teachers deploy innovative pedagogies to strengthen our students' literacy and numeracy skills through real-world, ICT-enriched learning contexts. The school adopts a multi-faceted approach to develop our students as well-rounded individuals, anchored in good character and equipped with the skills and social and emotional competencies to succeed in life.
