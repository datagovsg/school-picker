		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "energIze,exCite,and exalT! -Learning through empowering@SVPS is the school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP). Through project work, pupils acquire project skills which are taught progressively from P1 to P6 to deepen their cognitive engagement rather than focus only on the resulting product. Pupils also construct new knowledge and learn beyond the classroom to enrich and extend their learning. Pupils demonstrate both the 21CC and ICT skills and are inculcated with a strong sense of responsibility to family, community and the nation with an understanding of their roles in shaping the nation through values in action.  SVPS's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) Love Dance, Love Life! is aimed at promoting Music, Visual and the Performing Arts. Through its All-Talent-Passion(ATP) approach, All pupils learn dance, music and art through modular programmes. They also learn to appreciate different cultures, and gain a better understanding of them. Talented pupils join different Aesthetic CCAs for dedicated instruction and training. Pupils continue to pursue their Passion and  continue their learning as well as display their skills and passion on special occasions.  'We Love,We Can,We Learn' is the P1 transition programme unique to SVPS. Fostering children's social and emotional adjustment, knowledge, physical and life skills, it enables them to feel comfortable and familiar with the school environment and expectations. It involves families and recognises the important role they play in supporting children and staff to make school an exciting and engaging place. It also focuses on identifying and bridging the differences between children's prior-to-school experiences, supporting their overall development.  The Innochef programme allows all pupils to go through cooking lessons which are integrated with other subjects.It promotes the value of healthy eating through experiential and fully hands-on lessons, involveing pupils in activities which are multi-disciplinary in nature."
