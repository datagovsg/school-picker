		"School Mission": "Making lives, Waking hearts To serve the coming days Family, Society, Eternity    In order to make lives and wake hearts, our school has remained steadfast in keeping the fame burning bright to provide a holistic education anchored on character and citizenship education.   It is our desire for all boys who enter our gates to understand the purpose of lives on earth and wake their hearts so that they can have the desire to undertake mighty endeavours in service to others in the community",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "St Andrew's Village which consists of the SAJS, SASS and SAJC pride ourselves as one family where students have the opportunity to have twelve years of education in servant leadership. We believe that all who enters the gate can be educated to become servant leaders who brings life to the nation through developing our students to be holistic thinkers, skilled communicators and community builders with exemplary character demonstrating TRUE (Thanksgiving, Resilience, Unity, Empathy)  and WISE (Wonder, Integrity, Self-Discipline, Excellence)character values.   A holistic thinker applies analytical, reflective and creative thinking skills to his learning. An analytical thinker is able to reason logically and explain the decisions made based on evidence.  A reflective thinker is able to recount past experiences and link them to current situations to grow and make improvements in his learning. Creative thinking will help students to brainstorm and generate new ideas to respond appropriately to a given issue or challenge.   A skilled communicator listens attentively to others, expresses himself well and is media smart. He should be able to ask appropriate questions, to clarify or challenge others' ideas and points of view. He also demonstrates good posture and body language. By learning how to express himself, the skilled communicator shares his thoughts and feelings with clarity and confidence. He is able to engage others with mutual respect.  A community builder works effectively in teams. He is about to collaborate in a respectful manner and encourages others to contribute ideas to the team.   By actively participating in school and community activities, the community builder is able to demonstrate awareness and appreciation of people from different socio-cultural and religious backgrounds in the community. He contributes positively to others and the environment by demonstrating mutual respect and acceptable behaviour that promotes social cohesion.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our ALP has been endorsed by MOE since 2014. Each ALP programme aims to develop our students' creative thinking skills and community building skills. The programme for each level is as follows: P1 -  Saints as One Family Unbroken  P2 - Saints as part of the Potong Pasir Community P3 - Saints as Green Ambassadors P4 -  Saints as One Family Unbroken P5 -  Saints Honouring Pioneers in our Community P6 -  Saints as Entrepreneurs who Bless the Nations  Programme for Active Learning (PAL) The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is part of our P1 and P2 curriculum since 2012. It takes place on Friday mornings. It emphasises learning through hands-on experiences, having fun and enjoyment in the learning, and ongoing opportunities for peer interaction and self-discovery.  PAL provides a broad exposure of experiences to our pupils in the 4 domains: Sport & Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. Our boys work in groups to enhance their social skills.  In Sports & Games, our boys explore and experience movement in a group setting using animal themes. In Outdoor Education, they explored the outdoor landscapes around the St Andrew's Village, experienced navigation and building tents before enjoying a topographic game at the nearby Bishan Park. In Performing Arts, they explored sounds and rhythmic movements and experienced performing to their classmates. In Visual Arts, they explored age-appropriate art forms and express their creativity in a group setting.  The Servant Leadership Programme All boys are given opportunities to assume a role in the class committee from P1 as part of the servant leadership training. Some of these boys will also assume the role of junior leaders in P4 and move on to the Prefects and Prefect EXCO in P5 and 6.  They also have the opportunity to participate in a Servant Leadership Camp to learn from their seniors in SAJC and interact with other seniors from SASS and other cluster schools."
