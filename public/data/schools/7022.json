The school works closely with parents and other stakeholders to ensure that every student has a sound moral compass. The school motto \"Potest Qui Vult\", meaning \"He who wills, can\", is instilled in all students to enable them to respond with resilience in the face of challenges and adversity. The school also has a strong culture of care for all students and staff. It is within this caring environment that Patricians grow and develop to become mature and self-confident leaders who are always ready to serve society.
