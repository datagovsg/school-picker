		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Zhonghua is the South Zone Centre of Excellence for Science. As part of our Science and Technology Research Education, all our lower secondary students go through Design Thinking to equip every child with a problem-solving mindset, to come up with innovative solutions in the design of products to meet human-centric needs. At the higher levels, students are challenged in our Science Research Programme to solve real-life issues and problems under the mentorship of researchers from selected research institutes. Riding on the push for STEM education, our Robotics and Computing Programme has been integrated into our lower-secondary science and mathematics curricula for enhancing programming and creative problem-solving skills. GCE 'O' Computing and Music have been offered since 2017 to cater to the varied interests and aptitudes of our students. Our Environmental and Sustainability Education prepares our students to be future-ready leaders who reflect and research on the challenges that the world faces through experiential and collaborative learning experiences that take them beyond the classroom to explore the use of clean and green technology. The Student Leadership Programme nurtures forward-looking leaders with integrity and commitment to serve the school, the community and the nation and provides tiered leadership training and experiences to all students to level up their leadership competencies with an emphasis on empathy and compassion. Our MOE Art Elective Programme (AEP) adopts the Lincoln Centre Education approach that develops students' capacities for imagination and enables them to realise their artistic potential through a rigorous 4-year programme. Complementing this, the Glocal Perspective Education nurtures students to be cultured, caring and global citizens with a 'think-global-act-local' education by providing them with a plethora of opportunities to engage in a range of cultural activities and global immersion opportunities."
