		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Since 2005, Meridian Primary has placed strong emphasis on the importance of environmental education. The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) 'Nurturing Future Leaders, Citizens and Leaders through a Whole School Interdisciplinary Approach in Eco-Environmental Curriculum' aims to raise global awareness, perspectives and issues affecting the physical environment among our students. Adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, our students are provided with various platforms and opportunities that allow them to apply their knowledge and lead as they initiate and embark on meaningful eco-environmental programmes. These experiences will further instil in our students the values of care, concern and respect for the environment. Meridian Primary has also been collaborating closely with community partners in championing and promoting environment-related activities within and outside the school. Through this, we hope to groom and nurture Meridians to be future leaders who will continue to champion eco-environment efforts, not only in Singapore but beyond our shores.  The school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) 'Meridian Values-Based Student Leadership In Action For 21CC' is a six-year student leadership programme that has been designed to be progressive and age-appropriate, taking into consideration the readiness of our students at the respective levels. Through this programme, our students are provided with authentic opportunities for experiential learning and platforms to demonstrate our school values and 21CC. For our lower primary students, they start by exercising self-leadership before they progress at the middle and upper primary levels to become leaders who are confident, reflective and ready to be future leaders of Singapore. As Meridian Primary is part of a larger community, it leverages its strong partnership with community partners to identify and plan meaningful activities that allow our students to contribute back to our community."
