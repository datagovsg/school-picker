		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "In our school, we strive to provide the best environment and opportunities for our pupils i.e. Coralities so that they will develop holistically and maximise their potential. We strongly believe that every child is unique and gifted. It is up to all of us to discover and grow the talent of every chid so that he or she will experience success. To this end, we aim to provide quality education in a culture of care and excellence for Coralites.   While we place emphasis on academic excellence, we also seek to imbue in our young charges the right values, life skills and dispositions so that they are well equipped to seize opportunities and to thrive in a dynamic and ever-changing globalised world. The school programmes and environment have been carefully designed to revolve around the values that every Coralite upholds - \"Care\", \"Responsibility\", \"Respect\" and \"Resilience\".  The holistic development of our pupils would not have been possible without our partnerships with our various stakeholders. Our School Advisory Council members, Parent Support Group, community partners and parents have been most supportive of the school. Their presence and invaluable contributions have not only added value to the learning experience, but they have also given us the confidence and faith to continue in this meaningful pursuit of education as we serve our Coralites.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Education at Coral Primary School aims to develop leadership skills and promote character development by anchoring our students with values, equipping them with Social and Emotional competencies and building their dispositions towards lifelong learning.  The school's LLP - Visual Art programmes provide students with opportunities to develop their understanding and appreciation of values, culture and heritage through the learning, application and design of visual art. Visual Art programmes seek to develop visual literacy which enables our students to observe, understand and make meaning of what they see and communicate through visual expression and design.   At Coral Primary School, we recognise the importance of financial literacy as a very important life skill which will have a lasting impact throughout our students' lives. Financial literacy will serve our students well as they become self-reliant individuals of society who need to make responsible personal choices about their lifestyles. As students learn about money, they begin to grasp other broader life lessons such as goal-setting, decision-making and task responsibility.  The school adopts a whole school approach towards effective communication as we aim to provide our students with opportunities to develop their understanding and appreciation of the communication process and to enhance their oral communication skills. Such programmes seek to develop in our pupils an awareness of oral communication skills and a deeper understanding of the impact of language while taking into consideration the purpose, context and audience.   The Hydroponics Programme is a student-centred programme that combines technology and values programme. It provides students with experiences to stimulate their curiosity of the environment and reinforces the development of skills, habits of mind and attitudes necessary for scientific inquiry."
