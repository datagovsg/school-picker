		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The YTPS Total Curriculum Framework guides the staff in planning, implementing and evaluating learning opportunities for pupils holistically. The twin components of KNL (Knowledge skills, Numeracy and Literacy) and CCLAS (Citizenship, Creativity, Leadership, Action and Service) emphasise the holistic and balanced approach to education adopted by the school. The 3E (Engage, Explain and Evaluate) and 3A (Awareness, Attitude and Activate) approaches are adopted by the KNL and CCLAS component respectively.  At YTPS, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is delivered through CCLAS. CCLAS is adapted from the International Baccalaureate Diploma and the National Youth Achievement Award. Each domain in CCLAS is aligned to a specific subject in the formal curriculum, for example, Social Studies for the Citizenship domain.  Additionally, there is one distinctive programme under each component of the Total Curriculum Framework; the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) under KNL and Learning for Life Programme (LLP) under the Action domain of CCLAS.  Our ALP, D.R.E.A.M. (Developing Reflective learners, Empowering creAtive Minds)@YTPS, focuses on knowledge acquisition as well as skills like collaborative learning, communication and independent learning.. Through Project Work, pupils use the Creative Problem Solving tool to go beyond conventional thinking and arrive at novel and useful solutions to a problem posed in an authentic and meaningful manner. Carried out from P1 to P6, each Project Work is anchored on a core subject. This allows pupils to acquire knowledge of the subject content through a process of co-construction, collaboration and experiential learning.  Our LLP, entitled HEROES@YTPS, provides Holistic Enriching and Rewarding Outdoor Education & Sports experiences for every pupil at Yew Tee Primary. Pupils have the opportunity to participate in learning activities including Programme for Active Learning (PAL), adventure camps, CCAs and the Sports Fiesta."
