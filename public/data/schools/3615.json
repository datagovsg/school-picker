		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school was awarded the MOE Niche Programme in Environment education in 2010. It was one of 3 recipients of the 2012 President's Award for the Environment. In 2014, the school transitioned its niche into an Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - Eco-sustainability through Inquiry-Based Learning - in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The ALP offers a robust interdisciplinary curriculum for students to appreciate the vital connections between text-book knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems and arrive at useful solutions. This three-year programme provides students the opportunity to engage in critical inquiry, hands-on research and field investigations to apply scientific principles in real life situations. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Values And character buiLding through Outdoor cURiculum (VALOUR) - focuses on values acquisition and character building through an outdoor education curriculum. Unique learning opportunities incorporating adventure skills enhance students' self-esteem, self-confidence, independence and social-emotional competencies.  We customise the school curriculum to cater to students' interests, needs, abilities and learning styles. Our Normal Technical students are offered Retail Operations, an Applied Learning Subject. Students from the various courses are given the opportunities to take up Elective Modules and Advanced Elective Modules conducted at the Institutes of Technical Education and the Polytechnics respectively. All students are given opportunities to attain the National Youth Achievement Award (Bronze) through participation in Outdoor Adventure Camps and Values-in-Action (VIA) programmes."
