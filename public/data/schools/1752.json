		"School Mission": "To inspire and develop Riverlites to be responsible citizens and passionate learners.",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "The school's focus on 'The Whole Child in Every Riverlite' guides the school in its decisions, actions and interactions with its stakeholders in achieving its goals. A new set of core values, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care, Harmony, Excellence and Teamwork (R3ICHET), was initiated with effect from 2017 to complement the school's existing culture of care and excellence and to emphasise its focus on CCE. Desired behaviours are constantly communicated and emphasized to encourage students to demonstrate the core values through platforms such as assembly, school programmes and learning journeys. Other programmes under CCE, IP, Student Leadership, VIA and CCAs also reinforce the teaching and learning of these core values.   The school adopts the 'Leading by Serving' philosophy to support an inviting and vibrant school that leads by example and commits to the service for others. Staff and students practise 'Leading by Serving' through their participation in school programmes and activities: 'Keep My Classroom Clean', 'Good Morning, Rivervale!', 'A Helping towards My Friends' and 'P1 Buddying'. The school also adopts the Restorative Practice as part of its 'discipline with care' approach to help students take responsibility for their behaviour.   The school promotes safety and social responsibility among students through the 'Keep Myself Safe' and 'Keep My Friends Safe' campaigns. EAS staff are also involved in sustaining the culture of care through providing and supporting teachers and stakeholders with excellent service to realise the school's vision of the The Rivervale - School of Excellence, Individuals of Characters.",
