		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "At Elias Park, we believe that education must develop the whole child - the Scholar, Sportsman, Artist, Leader and Citizen in every individual student and his values system. That is why our key focus is on the holistic development of students and providing the platform and opportunities for them to realize their potential in the cognitive, physical, aesthetics, leadership, social and emotional domains. We pride ourselves in giving our students an authentic and experiential learning environment, extending the classroom to beyond 'bricks and mortar' - this is what we call the 'Elias Experience'. Our approach has produced confident and well-rounded individuals who can excel in both academic and non-academic domains.   Our school culture is based on the principles of autonomy, learning and care with a strong focus on professional development of our staff so that they are better equipped to deliver the Elias Experience to our students. We believe that every individual who joins the school wants to do his best, is worthy of respect and deserves to be heard. We aim to build a robust and trusting relationship with our students, staff and other stakeholders, including parents who are important partners in our educational journey with their children.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our Character In Action @ EPPS programme (Learning for Life Programme 1/ LLP1) seeks to develop students who are socially aware, have knowledge of current affairs and who can lead with moral courage. Lessons are designed around the 18 'SH@PE Alive! (Singapore Heritage @ Elias Park, where NE comes Alive!) Learning Galleries located within the school. These Galleries incorporate exhibits and other unique resource materials that expand on the traditional museum concept to include experiential and hands-on components to engage students in meaningful learning. As part of this LLP1, the school offers 23 different leadership roles to bring out the leader in every child. Students receive structured and progressive training to equip them with the competencies to lead and influence their peers and others.  Our Arts Creatively Expressed or ACE @ Elias (LLP2) programme develops the love for art and music in our students through Exposure, Experience and Appreciation. Students are trained to respond to what they see and express their ideas, feelings and experiences through various art forms and media. They will also discuss and interpret artworks and their value and impact in society. Our customized Music Curriculum provides opportunities for all Eliasians to learn at least one musical instrument by the end of their 6 years of education.  Our Modular CCA programme aims to appeal to a broader range of interests to make sure there is something for every student. The school offers 16 different and exciting CCA modules such as Cooking, Floral Arrangement, Inline Skating and Hip Hop Dance which fall under the 4 strands of Sports and Games, Science and Technology, National Education and Culture, and Life Skills.  Students complete four modules each year, one from each strand. The focus is on the holistic development of the child and providing students with a safe environment in which they can have different experiences and opportunities to explore their strengths and interests."
