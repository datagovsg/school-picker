		"School Vision": "Scholars of TomorrowScholars refers to Rulangnites who are equipped with the 21st Century Competencies; eventually grow to be people of integrity, imbued with a sense of community spirit, identity & responsibility as they take their places in our diverse society.Rulang envisions Tomorrow as a future that is full of uncertainties. Hence, Rulang aims to equip every Rulangnite with the skills and environment to develop resilience and adaptability which would help them thrive. Rulang also aims to inspire Rulangnites to meet future challenges while remaining rooted to the community and nation.",
		"School Mission": "Nurturing Competencies, Inspiring Excellence, Empowering IndividualsIn leading Rulangnites to be the Scholars of Tomorrow, it is Rulang's mission to equip them with the desired 21st Century Competencies. In embracing globalization, Rulangnites will also be exposed to civic literacy, global awareness and cross cultural skills while provided with plenty of opportunities for them to hone their critical and inventive thinking. Rulang strives to inspire pupils in achieving excellence in the five domains namely cognitive, aesthetics, physical, social and moral domains. Rulang believes in empowering individuals as every child can be nurtured to his or her fullest potential.",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "The school philosophy encapsulates our belief that given the right environment and support, all pupils can learn and achieve. Rulang aims to provide a holistic education that creates learning experiences to develop each pupil's intellectual capacities, character, aesthetics, sporting and leadership qualities through an enriched forward-looking learning environment beyond the classroom. Rulang is also committed in creating school experiences that are pupils centric and would equip pupils with the necessary knowledge, skills and values for living and working as active contributors in the 21st century. These areas include increasing resiliency in our students, use of ICT to deepen pedagogy and the promotion of an Aesthetics Culture to harness our pupils' creativity and curiosity.    The Rulang family is bonded by the culture of excellence, collegiality and teamwork. This culture and working ethics are based on the acronyms TRUE HEARTs where every staff is valued and every effort recognized and celebrated. The TRUE HEART culture spurs the staff towards quality staff work and school pride.   The TRUE HEARTs philosophy has also been cascaded to all Rulangnites. A Rulangnite is taught to never stop questioning, encouraged to blaze his own trail instead of accepting barriers, and to infuse the TRUE HEARTs culture and spirit into his everyday life. This will instill in Rulangnites the core leadership values of having integrity, being morally upright, and being a risk taker.   We believe that Rulangnites can achieve peaks of excellence by being the best that they can be in their chosen fields.  Upon completion of their primary education, they will each graduate as an accomplished learner, a loyal citizen, an effective leader and a cosmopolitan.",
