Holistic education is about nurturing the whole child, developing in our children an enduring core of skills, dispositions and competencies, steeped in values and character, to enable them to thrive in the future workplace, and more importantly, lead purposeful and meaningful lives.  JPS has been awarded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) status in Music and Performing Arts with our special programme known as the ECLIP (Every Child Leads in Instrumental Performance).  Through  this programme, not only will the students learn to appreciate, create and love music, but also develop in them other competencies and values in life.   Through music, we strive also to build in all our students leadership competencies.  To this end, we have embarked on a programme called Leader In Me programme which utilizes the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.  Our overseas immersion programes also help our students to sensitize them to the world around them."
