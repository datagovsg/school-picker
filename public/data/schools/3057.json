		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school offers the Applied Learning Programme (ALP), 'Nurturing Critical Thinkers Through the Learning of Sustainable Technology', in which students apply their learning of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in authentic settings. Students are taught to use the Design Thinking methodology to design, build and prototype devices which run on clean energy. Through this programme, students acquire 21st century competencies such as critical thinking and problem-solving skills that will put them in good stead in any STEM-related course of study that they wish to pursue in future. The school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) focuses on 'Growing Socially Responsible Citizens Through the Chong Boon Student Leaders Programme'. The LLP is integrated with various curricular and co-curricular programmes to equip students with key knowledge, skills and attitudes of a leader. The leadership training is based on Sean Covey's '7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens' and focuses on the development of self and peer leadership. The Chong Boon Growth Camp is a four- or five-year Character Development Programme through which students learn important life skills such as leadership, collaboration, communication, and develop social-emotional and cross-cultural competencies. Other innovative programmes that prepare our students for the future include the Life-Science Programme which adds value to the students' classroom learning as they acquire essential biology skills practiced in research laboratories, such as extraction of DNA and growing of bacteria. The school also partners the polytechnics to offer Advanced Elective Modules to provide greater diversity in learning experiences and expose students to applied topics such as Creative Product Design that will prepare them well for further education."
