		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "FTPPS endeavours to deliver a student centric, values driven education to enable them to attain the 4 FTPPS Student Outcomes - a confident person, a self-directed learner, an active contributor and a concerned citizen.  In Literacy through Photography(LTP), which is the school's Learning for Life Programme, we aim to nurture students to be self-directed and confident learners who are ICT savvy and can articulate their thoughts and inspirations through their photographs. LTP also seeks to develop active contributors who can cooperate and collaborate in teams during the photography sessions and nurture concerned citizens who are able to portray green efforts and raise awareness of the environment through photography.  The school believes in \"Every Student, A Leader\" -our guiding principle behind our student leadership programme where we nurture the leadership potential of every child. Our student leadership training programme focuses on equipping our students with the emerging 21st century competencies.  The school has a structured 6-year Values-in-Action(VIA) programme that engages students in authentic experiences. Leveraging the expanding environment approach to maximise learning impact, the programme allows students to learn progressively from first contributing to their homes, then to the school, and finally to the community and beyond.  An experiential approach is adopted for the promotion of nature conservation through our Environmental Education Programme- GoGreen@FTPPS. Students learn about Reduce, Reuse and Recycle through hands-on activities, outdoor camps and collaborative programmes with our stakeholders.  Our Global-Local Exchange Programme aims to give our students a head start in broadening their worldview, developing the ability to work with people from diverse cultural backgrounds and instilling in them a sense of commitment and rootedness to Singapore. Our students have the opportunities to participate in learning journeys to Hong Kong and Malacca."
