As a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school, our students learn both the English and Chinese as first languages. We are also one of the nine Gifted Education Programme (GEP) Centres in  Singapore.  Guided by the school's vision and mission and with the school's motto (Loyalty, Filial Piety, Humanity, Love, Courtesy, Righteousness, Integrity and Sense of Shame) as the foundational values, we aim to help every Nan Hua child develop into gracious citizen rooted in values and Chinese culture who is also a caring contributor of the society; one who leads with character and serves with a heart.   Our success story strongly builds on the basis that it takes 'a village to raise a child'. We firmly believe is collaborating closely with our key partners such as the members of our School Management Committee, Alumni Association, Parent Support Group, various community partners and parents to help our children in their development.

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our school believes in developing our children holistically and equipping them with the 21st century skills and competencies. To do so, we focus on 3 key areas: Thinking Minds, Engaged Hearts, Happy and Healthy Learners.    In the area of Thinking Minds, our school-wide curriculum focuses on the students' cognitive development, seeking to enhance and deepen students' understanding of the subject matter. The NHPS Thinking Programme, an Applied Learning Programme (ALP), is designed to develop our student's creative, inventive and critical thinking skills through integrated lessons and distinctive learning experiences. Through rich discussions in the classrooms, the use of stories, thinking games and mystery puzzles, our students are exposed and immersed in an environment that encourages thinking to become confident thinkers and thought-leaders in their own field.  This also inculcates in them a spirit of inquiry and a love for learning.    The Bilingual Elective Programme (BEP) aims to further nurture the passion for both the English and Chinese Languages in our students, for them to be effectively bilingual.   In the area of Engaged Hearts, we focus on the student's affective development. Our Environment Education curriculum aims to develop a strong green identity and to cultivate pro-environmental behaviour in our students. Our Values-in-Action Programme provides platforms where students can be actively involved in learning and appreciating the community which will help them develop their sense of commitment in playing their part and making a difference in the community.  In the area of Happy and Healthy Learners, we customised programmes which focus on managing self, relating to others positively and making responsible decisions.  Physical and Health Education as well as Co-curricular Activities are platforms for students to grow up strong, healthy and happy and at the same time discover and develop their strengths and passions."
