		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school offers a distinctive Learning for Life Programme: 'Good Values@BV'. Our emphasis is on developing character traits in all our students, as we believe they are critical success factors for the future. On a daily basis, we uphold school rules, regulations, routines and habits, as they help students to develop Integrity, Respect, Responsibility, Service and Excellence. Character development programmes like the 'Values in Action' programme and Student Leadership development programmes are designed to grow students into good citizens in service of the nation.  We also offer an Applied Learning Programme: 'Global Awareness for the 21st Century@BV' which serves to connect academic knowledge and skills with real world knowledge. Through a structured provision of opportunities, students will be exposed to a range of global issues in view of developing skills of critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. The school focuses on student-centric programmes to nurture the whole child through quality teaching and learning. These include academic enrichment programmes such as Public Speaking, Philosophy and programmes designed to meet the learning needs of segments of students like the 'Improve Confidence and Numeracy Skills in Mathematics' programme, the Applied Theatre Programme (MOE Excel Fest 2013), the Inquiry-Based Learning Programme in Geography (MOE Excel Fest 2014) and the Science Incubation Unit programmes to stretch students' knowledge and skills. Other holistic development programmes includes Annual Level Camps, Affective Learning in PE, Swimming and Internationalisation Programmes to various countries. The school is implementing greater flexibility in subject offering at lower secondary levels. Eligible N(A) and N(T) students can take some subjects at a higher level starting from Secondary 1, based on their PSLE results. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects."
