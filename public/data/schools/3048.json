Our F&A ALP is a four-year programme which builds real-life knowledge and skills and raises awareness of the different types of careers within the aerospace industry. Adding to the rigor in the Academics, CCA programmes and F&A ALP, we also have our Arts LLP for the holistic development of Hillgrovians. Through the Arts LLP, students will be able to articulate and communicate their ideas and talents effectively. As a school, we also want to ignite the students' interest and passion towards the Arts and for them to consider careers in the Arts."
