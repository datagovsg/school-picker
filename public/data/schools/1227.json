Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Empowerment through Sports Education, aims to equip every pupil with mental skills that will shape a positive mindset and be guided by positive habits of mind to demonstrate good values and strong character.  Delivered via our Xishan's Physical Education curriculum and Sports & Games modules, and integrated into the school's total curriculum, pupils' acquisition and practice of mental skills will be manifested through changing attitudes, mindsets and habits, thereby shaping their disposition and build their competencies to meet varied situations that they might encounter in life.      Environmental education is a strong tenet in the school to promote a strong sense of community responsibility, values inculcation and resource conservation."
