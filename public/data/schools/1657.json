		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Fengshan Primary School strives to develop the 21st century competencies in our students by leveraging the classroom as well as school-wide platforms.  The millennial student will be one who is independent and yet interdependent.  To achieve this aim, the school's Programme for Active Learning (PAL) offers learning experiences to develop soft skills in our students such as the ability to communicate clearly and cooperate with others, and instil the belief in their abilities to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge.  At the upper levels, the Interdisciplinary Project Work focuses on real-life problems to help students make sound decisions based on assessing various alternatives. Such learning transcends teaching from textbooks.  The school's Values In Action Programme, such as Project Get-to-know, Include & Value the Elderly, educates our students to be giving and responsible citizens through community involvement while providing opportunities for leadership qualities inculcation to become compassionate \"Leaders of Tomorrow\".   Overarching all that the school does is our commitment to inculcate the 'Can Do' Spirit in our students, to develop their resilience and to reinforce the culture of care and support for one another.  As part of the Character Focused Programme, the school infuses the development of a Champion Mindset and concept of Bucket Filling - both emphasising the importance of working hard and working together, to be reslient and self-reliant, and also a caring team player.  This is further reinforced by the school's Learning for Life Programme which provides a common ground for students of different backgrounds to learn and excel in more than one sport, while building on the social & emotional competencies in our students."
