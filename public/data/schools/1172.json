		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "The school believes in Student-Centric, Values-Driven Education (SVE) and adopted SVE in the design of the school's programmes and articulation of the school's vision, mission and values (INSPIRE - Integrity, Nation-loving, Sincerity, Perseverance, Independence, Respect and Excellence).  School Culture The school's culture of care and learning is anchored on the Core Theory of Success. It is actively promoted through building quality relationships, learning and development of staff, and development of pupils in the CAMPSL (Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical, Social and Student Leadership) domains. Values inculcation in Yishun Primary School (YPS) is structured and programmes such as Value of the Month Award and Garden of Values Wall engender the building of a positive psychosocial environment for learning. The inculcation of values in our students aims to develop individuals who are strong in character who will eventually be an asset to the society.   Striving for Excellence Over the years, YPS has been recognised for excelling in both the curricular and co-curricular areas. The school continues to provide its pupils with a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy skills, develop their love for learning and equip them with 21st Century Competencies and sound moral values to prepare them for life.    Staff and Teachers As Key Enablers  Every YPS graduate passes through the good and able hands of the school's teachers. The school continues to focus on developing its staff and teachers and building quality relationship with staff, teachers and stakeholders. The school believes that the quality of its programmes and the positive school outcomes are attributed to the quality of its people and the collective effort of the whole school collaborating and synergising together.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Learning for Life Programme (LLP): Viva De Symphonie - Championing Values: Living, Learning & Growing Through Music Anchoring on the approaches of Music for All and Music for Excellence, the school's LLP aims to develop pupil character through its 6-year progressive music programme. Pupils develop the joy of learning as they learn to play the various musical instruments. Young talents are systematically identified and developed through the school's music CCA groups. Opportunities are also given for them to be groomed at external platforms.   Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Environment Science The ALP aims to impart our pupils the practical concepts of science and its interplay with the environment through inquiry-based learning. Through the ALP, pupils develop entrepreneurial dare as they are engaged in the hands-on activities of creating new plant species through orchid hybridisation and nepenthes cultivation. Pupils develop 21CC (eg. Critical and Inventive Thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Information skills) as they collaborate with one another during the learning process. Pupils with greater interests are given opportunities to participate in global environmental activities and competitions.   Cultivating the spirit of learning through Design Thinking in Project Work Project Work in the school is exciting and engaging as pupils immerse themselves in the Design Thinking process in solving real world issues. Coupled with VIA and ALP, project work provides the platform for pupils to learn and apply their multi-disciplinary knowledge and skills.   PrAISE (Pre-Assembly Instruction For Student Engagement) and AR2ISE (All-Round Recess Instruction For Student Engagement) To develop all pupils holistically, they are involved in the school's PrAISE and AR2ISE programmes. Through these programmes, pupils are engaged in brain-based activities and game-based learning as an extension to the classroom instruction to develop their social-emotional and life skills."
