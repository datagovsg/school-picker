		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Values are very much part of life in Naval Base Primary School. Besides the rigorous academic programme, the school believes that character building is equally important in the development of the whole child. Students are reminded to Live Our Values Everyday (LOVE) where many of our programmes anchor on our school core values of Integrity, Respect, Self-Discipline, Compassion and Learning.   'NBPS Cares' is another programme anchored on the school value of Compassion. Recyclable items from the neighbourhood are collected by students and then sold. The proceeds from the sale are donated to Sree Narayana Mission Home. Through this initiative, students learn that their actions have a direct and positive impact on the less fortunate in our society and at the same time, they are helping the people in the neighbourhood with their recyclables and also doing their bit for the environment.   To provide an integrated platform for students to learn 21st century competencies in Critical and Inventive Thinking, our students are given the opportunity to creatively solve problems using Mathematics and Science concepts at the Navalites' Discovery Day (NDD). A programme that stretches students to think and explore beyond their textbooks. Weeks before NDD, students are given projects to research on. They work on proving their hypotheses with data gathered and come up with new inventions. All students' hard work culminates in the showcasing of their projects on NDD, where parents are invited to attend and celebrate their children's creativity.   Our Holistic Outdoor Physical Education & Sports (HOPES) Programme, a Learning for Life Programme (LLP), aims to develop in our students the 21st Century competencies and anchor on our school's core values through the Co-Curricular platforms. The programme aligns itself to the Physical Education & Sports Development Framework catering to mass participation, specialisation and talent development."
